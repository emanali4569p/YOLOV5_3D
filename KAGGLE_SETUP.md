# Kaggle Setup Guide for 3D Object Detection

This guide helps you run the 3D object detection model on Kaggle with the fixes for the DataLoader tensor conversion issues.

## Files to Use on Kaggle

### Core Files (Required)
- `kitti_dataset.py` - Fixed dataset class with proper tensor conversion
- `yolo3d_model.py` - 3D detection model
- `train_kaggle.py` - Kaggle-optimized training script
- `config.yaml` - Configuration file
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### Test Files (Optional)
- `test_dataset.py` - Test script to verify dataset works
- `evaluate_3d.py` - Evaluation script

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Upload Your Code
Upload all the required files to your Kaggle notebook or dataset.

### 2. Install Dependencies
```python
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Test the Dataset (Recommended)
Before training, test that the dataset works correctly:
```python
!python test_dataset.py
```

### 4. Run Training
```python
!python train_kaggle.py --data-dir /kaggle/input/your-kitti-dataset/Data
```

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Tensor Conversion Issue
- **Problem**: Images were sometimes returned as numpy arrays instead of PyTorch tensors
- **Solution**: Added proper fallback tensor conversion in `__getitem__` method
- **Location**: `kitti_dataset.py` lines 146-174

### 2. Collate Function Enhancement
- **Problem**: DataLoader couldn't stack mixed tensor/numpy arrays
- **Solution**: Enhanced collate function to ensure all images are tensors
- **Location**: `kitti_dataset.py` lines 230-236

### 3. Kaggle-Specific Optimizations
- **Reduced batch size** for memory constraints
- **Reduced num_workers** to avoid multiprocessing issues
- **Added error handling** for robust training
- **Suppressed CUDA warnings** that clutter Kaggle output

## Configuration for Kaggle

The `train_kaggle.py` script includes Kaggle-optimized settings:
- Batch size: 4 (reduced from 8)
- Num workers: 2 (reduced from 4)
- Proper data directory path handling
- Enhanced error handling

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get tensor errors:
1. Make sure you're using the updated `kitti_dataset.py`
2. Check that your data directory structure matches KITTI format
3. Run the test script first to verify everything works

### If you get CUDA warnings:
These are harmless and can be ignored. The script suppresses them automatically.

### Memory issues:
- Reduce batch size further in the config
- Reduce image size from 640 to 416 or 320
- Use gradient accumulation instead of large batches

## Expected Output

You should see:
```
Loaded 5984 samples for train split
Loaded 1497 samples for test split
Train samples: 5984
Validation samples: 1497
Training on device: cuda
Model parameters: 7,799,885
Starting training...
Epoch 1/100:   0%|                                      | 0/187 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
```

The training should proceed without the tensor conversion errors.
